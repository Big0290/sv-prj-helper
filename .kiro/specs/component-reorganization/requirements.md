# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature involves reorganizing the SV Project Helper UI Library component structure to create consistency between the existing `src/lib/components/` directory and the `src/lib/ui/` architecture. The goal is to migrate all components to appropriate folders within the UI system while maintaining functionality and improving maintainability.

## Glossary

- **Component Library**: The SV Project Helper UI Library built with Svelte 5
- **UI System**: The organized folder structure within `src/lib/ui/` containing atoms, molecules, organisms, layouts, utils, hooks, and theme
- **Legacy Components**: Components currently located in `src/lib/components/` directory
- **Atomic Design**: Design methodology organizing components by complexity (atoms → molecules → organisms)
- **Migration Process**: The systematic transfer of components from legacy location to UI system structure
- **Export System**: The centralized export mechanism through index files

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer using the component library, I want all components organized in a consistent UI system structure, so that I can easily find and understand the component hierarchy.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN analyzing component complexity, THE Component Library SHALL categorize each component into atoms, molecules, organisms, or layouts based on atomic design principles
2. WHEN migrating components, THE Component Library SHALL preserve all existing functionality and props interfaces
3. WHEN updating file locations, THE Component Library SHALL maintain TypeScript type exports and component exports
4. WHERE components have dependencies on other components, THE Component Library SHALL update import paths accordingly
5. THE Component Library SHALL ensure all migrated components follow Svelte 5 patterns with runes and snippets

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer maintaining the library, I want a clear categorization system for components, so that I can easily determine where new components should be placed.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Component Library SHALL define clear criteria for categorizing components as atoms, molecules, organisms, or layouts
2. WHEN components contain multiple sub-components, THE Component Library SHALL group related components appropriately
3. THE Component Library SHALL document the categorization rationale for complex or borderline cases
4. WHERE utility components exist, THE Component Library SHALL place them in the utils folder
5. THE Component Library SHALL ensure hook-related components are properly categorized or moved to hooks folder

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer using the library, I want all import paths to work correctly after reorganization, so that existing code continues to function without breaking changes.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Component Library SHALL update the main export file at `src/lib/index.ts` to reflect new component locations
2. THE Component Library SHALL update the UI system export file at `src/lib/ui/index.ts` with all migrated components
3. WHEN components import other components, THE Component Library SHALL update relative import paths to match new structure
4. THE Component Library SHALL ensure demo pages in `src/routes/` continue to work with updated import paths
5. WHERE components are re-exported, THE Component Library SHALL maintain backward compatibility through proper export aliases

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer working with the codebase, I want the file structure to be clean and organized, so that I can navigate the project efficiently.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Component Library SHALL remove the empty `src/lib/components/` directory after successful migration
2. THE Component Library SHALL ensure no duplicate components exist across old and new locations
3. THE Component Library SHALL organize components within each category folder in alphabetical order
4. WHERE component files have associated types or utilities, THE Component Library SHALL keep them co-located appropriately
5. THE Component Library SHALL verify all TypeScript declarations and build processes work correctly after reorganization
