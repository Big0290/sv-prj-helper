# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature involves reorganizing the existing Svelte 5 UI component library into a well-structured, documented package suitable for GitHub distribution and reuse across multiple projects. The system will provide comprehensive documentation, code examples, and an improved folder structure for better developer experience.

## Glossary

- **Component_Library**: The Svelte 5 UI component library being reorganized
- **Documentation_System**: The comprehensive documentation structure with examples and API references
- **Package_Structure**: The organized folder hierarchy for components and documentation
- **GitHub_Package**: The distributable npm package hosted on GitHub
- **Developer_Experience**: The ease of use and understanding for developers consuming the library

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a well-organized component library structure, so that I can easily find and understand available components.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Component_Library SHALL organize components into logical categories with clear hierarchy
2. WHEN a developer browses the library, THE Package_Structure SHALL provide intuitive navigation paths
3. THE Component_Library SHALL maintain backward compatibility with existing exports
4. THE Package_Structure SHALL separate documentation from source code clearly
5. THE Component_Library SHALL include a standardized naming convention for all components

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want comprehensive documentation for each component, so that I can understand how to use them effectively.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Documentation_System SHALL provide API documentation for every component
2. THE Documentation_System SHALL include interactive code examples for each component
3. WHEN a developer views component documentation, THE Documentation_System SHALL display props, events, and slots information
4. THE Documentation_System SHALL include accessibility guidelines for each component
5. THE Documentation_System SHALL provide usage examples with different variants and states

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to easily install and use components in my Svelte 5 projects, so that I can build applications efficiently.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE GitHub_Package SHALL be installable via npm with a single command
2. THE Component_Library SHALL export all components through a single entry point
3. WHEN importing components, THE GitHub_Package SHALL provide TypeScript definitions
4. THE Component_Library SHALL include tree-shaking support for optimal bundle sizes
5. THE GitHub_Package SHALL include installation and quick-start documentation

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a maintainer, I want a scalable documentation system, so that I can easily add new components and maintain existing ones.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Documentation_System SHALL use a consistent template for all component documentation
2. THE Documentation_System SHALL automatically generate component API documentation from TypeScript interfaces
3. WHEN adding new components, THE Documentation_System SHALL require minimal manual documentation setup
4. THE Documentation_System SHALL validate that all components have complete documentation
5. THE Documentation_System SHALL support versioning and changelog generation

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to see live examples of components, so that I can understand their behavior and styling.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Documentation_System SHALL provide interactive playground for each component
2. THE Documentation_System SHALL display component examples with editable code
3. WHEN viewing examples, THE Documentation_System SHALL show both light and dark theme variants
4. THE Documentation_System SHALL include responsive behavior demonstrations
5. THE Documentation_System SHALL provide copy-to-clipboard functionality for code examples
