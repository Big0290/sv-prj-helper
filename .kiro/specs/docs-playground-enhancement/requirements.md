# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature involves completing and enhancing the documentation playground section of the Svelte 5 UI component library webapp. The focus is on implementing a fully functional interactive playground with proper purpleish iOS26 liquid glassmorphism design system and ensuring all playground features work seamlessly for component testing and demonstration.

## Glossary

- **Docs_Playground**: The interactive component testing environment within the documentation webapp
- **Glassmorphism_Design**: The purpleish iOS26-inspired liquid glass visual design system with backdrop blur effects
- **Interactive_Controls**: Dynamic prop controls, theme switching, and responsive testing features
- **Live_Preview**: Real-time component rendering with applied props and styling
- **Code_Generation**: Automatic code generation based on selected props and configurations

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a fully functional interactive playground, so that I can test components with different props and see real-time changes.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Docs_Playground SHALL provide live prop controls for all component properties
2. WHEN a developer changes prop values, THE Live_Preview SHALL update immediately without page refresh
3. THE Docs_Playground SHALL generate accurate Svelte code based on current prop selections
4. THE Interactive_Controls SHALL support all prop types including booleans, strings, numbers, and union types
5. THE Docs_Playground SHALL maintain prop state during theme and viewport changes

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want proper glassmorphism styling throughout the playground, so that the interface matches the iOS26 liquid glass design system.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Docs_Playground SHALL apply consistent glassmorphism effects to all UI elements
2. THE Glassmorphism_Design SHALL use proper backdrop blur, transparency, and purple color palette
3. WHEN switching themes, THE Glassmorphism_Design SHALL adapt smoothly with proper transitions
4. THE Docs_Playground SHALL implement proper glass borders, shadows, and hover effects
5. THE Glassmorphism_Design SHALL maintain accessibility standards with sufficient contrast ratios

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want responsive testing capabilities, so that I can see how components behave across different screen sizes.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Docs_Playground SHALL provide mobile, tablet, and desktop viewport simulation
2. WHEN switching viewport sizes, THE Live_Preview SHALL resize smoothly with visual indicators
3. THE Interactive_Controls SHALL remain accessible and functional across all viewport sizes
4. THE Docs_Playground SHALL show actual pixel dimensions for each viewport mode
5. THE Docs_Playground SHALL maintain component functionality during responsive testing

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want theme switching functionality, so that I can test components in both light and dark modes.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Docs_Playground SHALL provide seamless light/dark theme switching
2. WHEN switching themes, THE Live_Preview SHALL update component appearance immediately
3. THE Docs_Playground SHALL maintain theme state across different components and examples
4. THE Glassmorphism_Design SHALL adapt properly to both light and dark themes
5. THE Docs_Playground SHALL support system theme preference detection

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want code export and sharing capabilities, so that I can easily use the configured components in my projects.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Code_Generation SHALL produce clean, properly formatted Svelte component code
2. THE Docs_Playground SHALL provide copy-to-clipboard functionality for generated code
3. WHEN exporting code, THE Code_Generation SHALL include all active props and configurations
4. THE Docs_Playground SHALL support exporting examples as downloadable Svelte files
5. THE Code_Generation SHALL maintain proper TypeScript typing in exported code
