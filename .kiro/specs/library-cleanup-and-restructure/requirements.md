# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature involves transforming the SV Project Helper UI Library from a development workspace into a clean, production-ready npm package. The goal is to remove all demo content, development files, duplications, and unnecessary documentation while establishing a proper library structure suitable for distribution and consumption by other projects.

## Glossary

- **UI Library**: The SV Project Helper UI Library built with Svelte 5 for distribution as an npm package
- **Demo Content**: Example applications, routes, and showcase components not needed in the distributed library
- **Development Files**: Temporary documentation, implementation notes, and development-specific configurations
- **Library Package**: The final npm-installable package containing only essential components, types, and documentation
- **Distribution Build**: The compiled library output optimized for consumption by other projects
- **Component Documentation**: API documentation and usage examples for each component
- **Package Structure**: The organized file hierarchy suitable for npm publishing

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer installing the UI library, I want to receive only the essential library files, so that my project doesn't include unnecessary demo content or development artifacts.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE UI Library SHALL remove all demo routes and example applications from the distributed package
2. THE UI Library SHALL remove all development markdown files that are not essential documentation
3. THE UI Library SHALL eliminate duplicate component structures between `src/lib/components/` and `src/lib/ui/`
4. WHERE development scripts exist, THE UI Library SHALL retain only those necessary for library building and publishing
5. THE UI Library SHALL ensure the package contains only production-ready components and utilities

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer using the library, I want clear, component-based documentation, so that I can understand how to use each component effectively.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE UI Library SHALL provide API documentation for each component including props, events, and slots
2. THE UI Library SHALL include usage examples for each component in a structured format
3. THE UI Library SHALL organize documentation by component category (atoms, molecules, organisms, layouts, utils)
4. WHERE components have complex configurations, THE UI Library SHALL provide comprehensive configuration examples
5. THE UI Library SHALL ensure documentation is generated from component source code to maintain accuracy

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer maintaining the library, I want a clean project structure, so that I can efficiently develop and maintain components without confusion from legacy files.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE UI Library SHALL consolidate all components into a single, organized directory structure
2. THE UI Library SHALL remove empty directories and unused configuration files
3. THE UI Library SHALL eliminate redundant build outputs and generated files from source control
4. WHERE configuration files exist, THE UI Library SHALL retain only those essential for library functionality
5. THE UI Library SHALL ensure the project structure follows npm package best practices

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer installing the library from npm, I want proper package configuration, so that I can import and use components seamlessly in my project.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE UI Library SHALL configure package.json with proper main, module, and types entry points
2. THE UI Library SHALL ensure all components are properly exported through index files
3. THE UI Library SHALL provide TypeScript declarations for all components and utilities
4. WHERE peer dependencies exist, THE UI Library SHALL declare them correctly in package.json
5. THE UI Library SHALL configure the build system to output ES modules suitable for modern bundlers

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer contributing to the library, I want clear development guidelines, so that I can maintain consistency and quality when adding new components.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE UI Library SHALL provide a comprehensive README with installation and usage instructions
2. THE UI Library SHALL include development setup instructions for contributors
3. THE UI Library SHALL document the component creation and organization guidelines
4. WHERE coding standards exist, THE UI Library SHALL document them clearly for contributors
5. THE UI Library SHALL ensure the development workflow supports efficient component development and testing
