# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature creates a comprehensive LLM-optimized documentation file that provides complete API reference and usage guidance for the SV Project Helper UI Library. The documentation will serve as the ultimate context prompt for LLMs to understand and work with the component library effectively.

## Glossary

- **LLM_Documentation_System**: The system that generates comprehensive API documentation optimized for Large Language Model consumption
- **Component_Analyzer**: The subsystem that extracts component APIs, props, and interfaces from source code
- **Design_System_Documenter**: The subsystem that documents theming, styling, and design patterns
- **Usage_Pattern_Extractor**: The subsystem that identifies and documents common usage patterns and examples
- **API_Reference_Generator**: The subsystem that creates structured API documentation for each component
- **Accessibility_Documenter**: The subsystem that documents accessibility features and requirements
- **Type_Interface_Extractor**: The subsystem that extracts and documents TypeScript interfaces and types

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer using an LLM assistant, I want comprehensive component documentation, so that the LLM can provide accurate guidance on using the UI library.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the LLM_Documentation_System analyzes the component library, THE Component_Analyzer SHALL extract all component props, interfaces, and type definitions
2. WHEN a component has TypeScript interfaces, THE Type_Interface_Extractor SHALL document all interface properties with their types and descriptions
3. WHEN components have accessibility features, THE Accessibility_Documenter SHALL document ARIA attributes, keyboard navigation, and screen reader support
4. WHEN components use design system patterns, THE Design_System_Documenter SHALL document theming variables, glassmorphism effects, and responsive behavior
5. WHERE components have usage examples, THE Usage_Pattern_Extractor SHALL include practical implementation examples

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As an LLM assistant, I want structured API reference documentation, so that I can provide accurate component usage guidance.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the API_Reference_Generator processes a component, THE LLM_Documentation_System SHALL create structured documentation with props, events, slots, and methods
2. WHEN components have default values, THE Component_Analyzer SHALL document all default prop values and their rationale
3. WHEN components have variants or themes, THE Design_System_Documenter SHALL document all available options and their visual effects
4. WHEN components have dependencies, THE LLM_Documentation_System SHALL document required imports and peer dependencies
5. WHERE components have complex interactions, THE Usage_Pattern_Extractor SHALL provide step-by-step implementation guides

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want design system documentation, so that I can understand theming, styling, and visual consistency patterns.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the Design_System_Documenter analyzes the theme system, THE LLM_Documentation_System SHALL document all CSS custom properties and their purposes
2. WHEN glassmorphism effects are used, THE Design_System_Documenter SHALL document backdrop-filter values, opacity settings, and visual hierarchy
3. WHEN responsive breakpoints exist, THE Design_System_Documenter SHALL document mobile-first design patterns and breakpoint values
4. WHEN dark mode is supported, THE Design_System_Documenter SHALL document color scheme detection and theme switching mechanisms
5. WHERE accessibility considerations affect styling, THE Accessibility_Documenter SHALL document focus indicators, contrast ratios, and reduced motion support

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As an LLM assistant, I want component categorization and organization, so that I can recommend appropriate components for specific use cases.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the LLM_Documentation_System categorizes components, THE Component_Analyzer SHALL organize components by atomic design hierarchy (atoms, molecules, organisms)
2. WHEN components serve similar purposes, THE Usage_Pattern_Extractor SHALL group related components and document their differences
3. WHEN components have specific use cases, THE LLM_Documentation_System SHALL document recommended scenarios and anti-patterns
4. WHEN components have performance considerations, THE Component_Analyzer SHALL document optimization guidelines and best practices
5. WHERE components integrate with external libraries, THE LLM_Documentation_System SHALL document integration patterns and configuration requirements

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want comprehensive examples and patterns, so that I can implement components correctly and efficiently.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the Usage_Pattern_Extractor generates examples, THE LLM_Documentation_System SHALL provide minimal working code samples for each component
2. WHEN components have complex configurations, THE Usage_Pattern_Extractor SHALL provide progressive examples from basic to advanced usage
3. WHEN components work together, THE Usage_Pattern_Extractor SHALL document composition patterns and component combinations
4. WHEN components have event handling, THE Usage_Pattern_Extractor SHALL provide event listener examples and callback patterns
5. WHERE components have performance implications, THE Usage_Pattern_Extractor SHALL document optimization techniques and best practices

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As an LLM assistant, I want accessibility documentation, so that I can ensure generated code meets WCAG 2.1 AA compliance standards.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the Accessibility_Documenter analyzes components, THE LLM_Documentation_System SHALL document all ARIA attributes and their purposes
2. WHEN components support keyboard navigation, THE Accessibility_Documenter SHALL document all keyboard shortcuts and navigation patterns
3. WHEN components have focus management, THE Accessibility_Documenter SHALL document focus trapping, restoration, and visual indicators
4. WHEN components announce changes, THE Accessibility_Documenter SHALL document screen reader announcements and live regions
5. WHERE components have motion effects, THE Accessibility_Documenter SHALL document reduced motion alternatives and user preferences
